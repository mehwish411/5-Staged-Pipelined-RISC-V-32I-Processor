# 5-Staged-Pipelined-RISC-V-32I-Processor
5 stage pipeline implementation of RISC-V 32I Processor.
In this repository, I have implemented a 5-stage pipelined processor. This project displays the design and implementation of a processor with pipelining, showing the transition from a theoretical single-cycle processor design to an efficient pipelined architecture.

For 5 staged pipelining, we'll divide our instruction into 5 different stages.
Instruction Fetch
Instruction Decode
Instruction Execution
Memory Read/Write
Write Back
This pipelined implementation of processor supports six basic instructions:

R-Type
I-Type
S-Type
B-Type
J-Type
U-Type
